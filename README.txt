"Calendar" is a software project developed by Vilius Vaičiūnas and Linas Jonas Žilinskas. It is designed to provide the user with a highly flexible time-managing user interface, designed for institutions with authoritative hierarchies. The program provides functionality for multiple users, hierarchies and administration, as well as personal events, personal schedules, public events, user groups and customization. All code is hand-written with the use of the Eclipse Mars.2 IDE.
